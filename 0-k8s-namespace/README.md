**Kubernetes Namespace**
A Kubernetes namespace is a virtual cluster within a Kubernetes cluster. It is a way to divide cluster resources into separate virtual clusters, allowing you to organize and isolate different workloads or environments within the same physical cluster.

**Namespaces provide the following benefits:**
- **Resource isolation**: Each namespace has its own set of resources, such as pods, services, and storage volumes. This allows you to isolate workloads from each other, preventing interference and conflicts.
- **Access control**: Kubernetes provides Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) mechanisms that allow you to control access to resources within namespaces. This enables you to grant different permissions to different teams or users.
- **Resource quotas**: You can set resource quotas on namespaces to limit the amount of compute resources (CPU, memory) and storage that can be consumed by workloads within the namespace. This helps prevent one workload from monopolizing cluster resources.
- **Environment segregation**: Namespaces can be used to segregate different environments, such as development, staging, and production. This makes it easier to manage and deploy applications across different stages of the software development lifecycle.

**Example:**

For example, suppose you have a Kubernetes cluster used by multiple teams in your organization. You can create separate namespaces for each team, such as `development`, `staging`, and `production`. Within each namespace, the team can deploy their applications and services without affecting other teams' workloads.

Here's how you can create a namespace in Kubernetes:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: development
```
