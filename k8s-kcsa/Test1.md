1. What is a key security measure to prevent malicious code execution in Kubernetes containers?\
Ans- Using minimal base images and scanning containers for vulnerabilities
2. What is a critical security practice to protect the Kubernetes API Server from being overloaded by requests, which could potentially lead to a denial of service?\
Ans- Applying Rate Limiting on the API Server
3. In a Kubernetes environment, which security control is most effective for ensuring that only trusted container images are deployed?\
Ans- Using an Image Policy Webhook
4. Why is implementing centralized logging in a Kubernetes environment an important aspect of observability for platform security?\
Ans- To enable detection and analysis of security incidents and anomalies
5. Why is configuring resource limits and requests for pods important in preventing Denial of Service within a Kubernetes cluster?\
Ans- To prevent individual pods from consuming excessive resources and impacting cluster stability.
6. Which of the following is an effective isolation technique for securing containerized applications by preventing container escape attacks?\
Ans- Utilizing Runtime Security Tools
7. What is the primary purpose of the ‘Privileged’ policy in Kubernetes Pod Security Standards?\
Ans: To allow a pod to execute with elevated privileges that can override default security constraints
8. Why is understanding data flow within a Kubernetes cluster critical in its threat modeling?\
Ans- To identify potential points of data leakage or unauthorized data access in the cluster
9. Your organization is deploying a cloud-native application on a public cloud provider. Which of the following is a key responsibility of the cloud provider in terms of infrastructure security?\
Ans- Protecting the physical infrastructure of the data centers
10. What is the primary purpose of using the DREAD threat modeling framework in Kubernetes environments?\
Ans- o evaluate and prioritize the severity of potential security threats in Kubernetes
11. How does integrating Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines with security automation tools benefit Kubernetes security?\
Ans- By automatically detecting and addressing security vulnerabilities during the development and deployment phases.
