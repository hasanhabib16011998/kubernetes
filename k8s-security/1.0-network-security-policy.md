## Use Network Security Policies to Restrict Cluster-Level Access

The Certified Kubernetes Security Specialist (CKS) exam covers various topics related to securing Kubernetes clusters, including network security policies. Here's a breakdown of what you need to know about using network security policies to restrict cluster-level access for the CKS exam:

**Understanding Network Security Policies (NSPs):**

- Network Security Policies are Kubernetes resources used to define rules for controlling inbound and outbound traffic to and from pods within a cluster.
- NSPs operate at the pod level and can be used to control traffic within a cluster or between clusters.
- NSPs are defined using YAML manifests and can specify rules based on IP addresses, ports, and protocols.

## 4C's of Cloud Native Security
To help you organize your cloud-native security strategy, you can divide the security infrastructure into four categoriesâ€”the cloud layer, the container layer, the cluster layer, and the code laye.

1. **Code**:
   - **Secure Development Practices**: Focuses on writing secure code and implementing secure coding practices during the software development lifecycle (SDLC).
   - **Secure Supply Chain**: Involves securing the software supply chain by ensuring the integrity and authenticity of dependencies and third-party libraries used in cloud-native applications.

2. **Container**:
   - **Container Image Security**: Focuses on securing container images used in cloud-native environments.
   - **Container Runtime Security**: Involves securing the container runtime environment to prevent container escapes, privilege escalation, and other runtime attacks.

3. **Cluster**:
   - **Orchestration Security**: Focuses on securing Kubernetes clusters and other container orchestration platforms used in cloud-native environments.
   - **Cluster Monitoring and Logging**: Involves implementing monitoring and logging solutions to track cluster activity, detect security incidents, and investigate security breaches.

4. **Cloud**:
   - **Cloud Infrastructure Security**: Focuses on securing the underlying cloud infrastructure used to deploy and run cloud-native applications.
   - **Cloud Provider Security**: Involves understanding and managing the security responsibilities shared between cloud service providers and customers.
