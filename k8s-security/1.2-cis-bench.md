<h2>Center for Internet Security (CIS) Benchmarks</h2>

## What are CIS Benchmarks ?

CIS Benchmarks are security best practices and configuration guidelines developed by the Center for Internet Security (CIS). They provide recommendations for securing various technologies, including operating systems, cloud services, and network devices. The benchmarks are developed through a collaborative process involving cybersecurity professionals, subject matter experts, and CIS communities to ensure they address real-world security challenges.

CIS Benchmarks are widely used for:

1. Security Hardening: They help organizations harden their systems by providing detailed, step-by-step instructions for configuring security settings.
2. Compliance: Many regulatory and industry standards reference or incorporate CIS Benchmarks, making them useful for achieving compliance with various security frameworks.
3. Risk Management: By following CIS Benchmarks, organizations can reduce their risk of security incidents by addressing common vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.
4. Auditing: They provide a comprehensive checklist for auditing the security posture of systems and networks.
The benchmarks cover a wide range of technologies, such as Windows and Linux operating systems, cloud services (like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud), network devices, and applications. Each benchmark includes different levels of security configurations, allowing organizations to choose the level of security that best fits their needs.

### Here are some seccomp profile related questions
We have installed the CIS-CAT Pro Assessor tool called Assessor-CLI, under /root.\
Please run the assessment with the Assessor-CLI.sh script inside Assessor directory and generate a report called index.html in the output directory /var/www/html/.Once done, the report can be viewed using the Assessment Report tab located above the terminal.
Run the test in interactive mode and use below settings:\
Benchmarks/Data-Stream Collections: : CIS Ubuntu Linux 20.04 LTS Benchmark v2.0.1\
Profile : Level 1 - Server\

```bash
cd /root/Assessor
sh ./Assessor-CLI.sh -i -rd /var/www/html/ -nts -rp index
```
- -i: An unspecified flag, possibly for initializing or running interactively.
- -rd /var/www/html/: Sets the root or report directory to /var/www/html/.
- -nts: Another unspecified flag, potentially to omit timestamps or summaries.
- -rp index: Sets the report prefix or name to "index."

## CIS Kubernetes Benchmark
The CIS Kubernetes Benchmark provides security guidelines for securing Kubernetes clusters. Here are the key recommendations:

Key Components and Recommendations:
1. Control Plane Components:
- API Server: Secure with TLS, restrict access, enable authentication/authorization, configure logging/auditing.
- Controller Manager & Scheduler: Use secure communication and minimal privileges.
- Etcd: Encrypt data, secure communication, restrict access.

2. Worker Nodes:
- Kubelet: Secure communication, configure authentication/authorization, restrict access.
- Configuration Files: Protect and secure configuration files.
- Pod Security: Use Pod Security Policies, control privileged containers, set security contexts.

3. Policies and Procedures:
- RBAC: Implement Role-Based Access Control for permissions and access control.
- Network Policies: Control traffic between pods.
- Audit Logging: Enable and configure audit logging.

4. Best Practices:
- Encryption: Encrypt data in transit and at rest.
- Namespace Security: Isolate workloads with secure namespaces.
- Image Security: Use trusted registries, scan images for vulnerabilities.
