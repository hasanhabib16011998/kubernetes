Enable auditing in this kubernetes cluster. Create a new policy file that will only log events based on the below specifications:


Namespace: prod
Level: metadata
Operations: delete
Resources: secrets

Log Path: /var/log/prod-secrets.log
Audit file location: /etc/kubernetes/prod-audit.yaml
Maximum days to keep the logs: 30
Once the policy is created it, enable and make sure that it works.

Auditing Enabled?
Correct Log Path Used?
Correct log retention set?
Policy working as expected?



4. In the dev namespace create below resources:

- A role dev-write with access to get, watch, list and create pods in the same namespace.
- A Service account called developer and then bind dev-write role to it with a rolebinding called dev-write-binding.
- Finally, create a pod using the template /root/dev-pod.yaml. The pod should run with the service account developer. Update /root/dev-pod.yaml as necessary


- dev-write role created?
- dev-write role created for pods?
- dev-write role created for correct permissions?
- developer serviceaccount created?
- RoleBinding created?
- RoleBinding created with correct role and serviceaccount?
- dev-pod created with correct serviceAccount?
